    PypeRaptor is a library that provides a functional pipeline structure.
    Each execution from the pipeline takes an input item from beginning to end and return the result.
    The Pipeline may be modified by add operator and expects a Node.
    To execute a Pipeline for a single item, user can execute **push** function with item. This execution will pushes the input
    through the pipeline calling every function in the way.
    To execute several items, user can set an Iterable in **process** function.

    A generator can be part of the pipeline, and is recommended to be the first item to when using Pipeline in parallel mode.
    When in parallel mode, PypeRaptor provides a Device as in a way to reserve resources and avoid racing conditions among its threads.
